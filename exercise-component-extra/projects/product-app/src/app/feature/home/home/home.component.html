<h1>
  Welcome to exercise - Component extra, 3rd party libs, lazy loading,
  animations, ...
</h1>

<p class="!my-8 !text-2xl !font-light">
  In this exercise, we're going to explore how to use components from
  non-Angular 3rd party libraries and by doing so explore additional concepts
  like view children or content projection as well as lazy loading of heavy
  components and animations.
</p>

<ul class="text-lg">
  <li>How to implement wrapper components for 3rd party libraries</li>
  <li>How to lazy load heavy components using <code>&#64;defer</code></li>
  <li>How to implement and use Angular animations</li>
  <li>How to run logic outside of Angular change detection</li>
</ul>

  Compared to where we left off we have added a couple of things, namely, we
  have added the helper change detection counter in the toolbar (left side)
  which will be important to demonstrate some of the concepts in this exercise.
  Besides we have added a date helper in <code>core/util/</code> folder which
  will be used to generate mock year month combinations for the chart component.
  And we have also pre-generated the chart component itself in order to be able
  to specify TODO items for the exercise. (Normally we would generate it using
  Angular Schematics IDE integration)
