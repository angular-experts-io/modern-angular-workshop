# Welcome to exercise - Backend API communication

In this exercise were going to explore how to communicate with a backend API using
`HttpClient` and how to create a simple backend service to encapsulate the communication logic.

- How to setup `HttpClient`
- How to create a backend service
- How to load data in the component (and disadvantages of doing so)
- How to "subscribe" to backend without subscription or async pipe data using Angular Signals RxJs interop package
- How to use Angular interceptors

> Compared to where we left off, we have removed some of the mocks we provided earlier and introduced
> two new UI components, card and chip which are going to make our UI look a bit more interesting.
> Make sure to check their implementation in the `ui/` folder, they are pretty simple and self-explanatory.

**Search for the  `// TODO` items in the code itself by searching the `projects` folder using IDE or text editor search functionality**

## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can and **should be started** using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch`
- every exercise has its own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO` in the readme and `// TODO` comments inside the source code (eg `// TODO 2: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
- you can always search for `// TODO`, or `<!-- TODO` or check `README.md` for the next TODO item
