# Welcome to exercise - Forms state handling

In this exercise, we're going to explore how to implement Angular form state handling using an editor
approach which can be used to both create new and update existing items.

- How to reset the form to its initial state
- How to integrate form with external data source (eg, API or store)
- How to prevent users from navigating away from the form with unsaved changes

> Compared to where we left off we have...

**Search for the  `TODO <index>:`, eg `TODO 1:`  items in the code itself by searching the `projects` folder using IDE or text editor search functionality**


## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can and **should be started** using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch`
- every exercise has its own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO` in the readme and `// TODO` comments inside the source code (eg `// TODO 2: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
- you can always search for `// TODO`, or `<!-- TODO` or check `README.md` for the next TODO item
