## API (backend) requests

- the `npm start` starts both frontend and simple backend which serves `db.json` file (as CRUD json API)
- performing backend requests will change content of that file
- the content can be "reset" by comping content from `db-backup.json` file into `db.json` file
- the content can be "reset" by performing git rollback on the `db.json` file
