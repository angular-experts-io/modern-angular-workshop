**Search for the  `TODO <index>:`, eg `TODO 1:`  items in the code itself by searching the `projects` folder using IDE or text editor search functionality**


## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can and **should be started** using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch`
- every exercise has its own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO` in the readme and `// TODO` comments inside the source code (eg `// TODO 2: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
- you can always search for `// TODO`, or `<!-- TODO` or check `README.md` for the next TODO item
